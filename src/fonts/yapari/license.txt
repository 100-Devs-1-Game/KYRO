The primary typeface used in this open-source project's user interface is YAPARI, 
an impactful display font chosen to align with the game's stylistic vision. Please 
be aware that the YAPARI typeface is governed by a separate commercial license, 
which we purchased for its use here. Due to the terms of this license, we are only 
permitted to distribute and include the Bold weight of the font (YAPARI-Bold.ttf) 
within the project's open-source assets. While this particular weight is included 
to ensure the core visual identity is preserved, this distribution does not grant 
any user the right to utilize the font in their own separate projects or to distribute 
the other weights (such as Regular, Light, etc.). If you are a user or contributor who 
wishes to experience the full design as intended, including the variable weight transitions 
seen in external media, you would need to purchase or license the complete YAPARI font family 
independently from its foundry. For contributors who require a fully open-source, unrestricted 
typeface for development, or for users who simply prefer a different option, we recommend using 
a visually similar, open-source alternative as a drop-in replacement.
