KYRO is a game jam creation that blends the core mechanics of a first-person shooter with the high-speed intensity of an on-rails runner. Players are strapped into a fixed forward-moving path, armed with a single pistol, and must precisely shoot down robotic targets and other obstacles that appear and disappear in the minimalist environment. It's a test of reflexes and accuracy, offering a challenging arcade experience perfect for competitive speed runs, made in almost 3 days.
